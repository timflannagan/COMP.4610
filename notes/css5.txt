Lecture #8: CSS (5th lecture on CSS):

- Key Concepts in positioning elements:
  • Idea here is that we want to group a number of elements inside of a div
  1. Block level: starts on a new line
     • Examples include: h1, p, ul, li by default
  2. Inline: content flows in between surrounding text
     • Examples include: img, b, and i

- Controlling the position of the elements:
  • Normal Flow
  • Relative Positioning
  • Absolute Positioning
  • Fixed Positioning
  • Floating Elements
