Lecture #7: CSS (4th Lecture on CSS):
- Key Concepts:
  • The CSS box model
  • Width-Height: pixels, ems, and percentages are most popular ways to specify size
    - When you use percentages, the size of a box is relative to the size of
      the browser window. If its a nested block, then that's relative to the
      size of the outer block.
  • Min-width, Max-width:
    - Min-width: smallest size a box can be displayed at when the browser window
      is narrow; max-width: maximum a box can stretch to when the browser window
      is wide.
  • Overflow: tells the browser what to do if the content contained within a box
    is larger than the box itself.
    - Hidden: property simply hides any extra content that does not fix in the box.
    - Scroll: this property adds a scrollbar to the box so that user can scroll
      to see the missing content.
  • Borders:
    1. Border-width
    2. Border-style
    3. Border-color
    4. Border-radius
    - Shorthand:
      • border: 3px dotted #0088dd;
  • Padding
  • Centering-content using margin:
    - Set left-margin, right-margin to auto if you want to center a box on the
      page, or center it in an element that it sits in.
    - Note: this will center the element if you set display: block.
  • Display:
    1. Inline: causes a block-level element to act like an inline element.
    2. Block: causes an inline element to act like a block-level element.
    3. Inline-block: causes a block-level element to flow like an inline element,
       while retaining other features of a block-level element.
    4. None: this hides an element from the page.

Lecture #8: CSS (5th lecture on CSS):
- Key Concepts in positioning elements:
  • Idea here is that we want to group a number of elements inside of a div
  1. Block level: starts on a new line
     • Examples include: h1, p, ul, li by default
  2. Inline: content flows in between surrounding text
     • Examples include: img, b, and i

- Controlling the position of the elements:
  • Normal Flow
  • Relative Positioning
  • Absolute Positioning
  • Fixed Positioning
  • Floating Elements
